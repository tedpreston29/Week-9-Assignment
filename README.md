Reflection:
I really enojyed this project it. It brought together everything we have learnt this afr in the course really nicely.

I still struggle with db queries as I cant visualise the connections in my head very well. I have started to physically draw them out on paper which helps a little bit but this is an area I need to improve on as it slows me down quite a lot.

I enjoy the concepts in this assignment like using auth() and using component libraries like RadixUi(even though I didnt get to use them in this as I did not have time to.)

I think I still need to hammer in the fundamentals of coding fully to strengthen my overall skills. I can understand concepts quite well, however when implementing them, I get overwhelmed with all the variations I can use and I can spend forever thinking about what is next.

I will definitely continue working on this in my own time and add more features. Unfortunately I didnt have time to add any component libraries but I will try add this in future. I did add a modal for the add posts section which was fun to implement.
