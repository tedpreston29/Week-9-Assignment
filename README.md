Project Summary:

This project is a simple social media application built with Next.js, featuring Clerk authentication for user sign-up and login. Once a user signs in, they are redirected to a Create Profile page, which stores their information in a separate Supabase database table linked by a foreign key. Users can create new posts, view seeded posts, and see example comments. The app demonstrates database interaction, user authentication, and protected routes within a modern full-stack Next.js setup.

Project Reflection:
I really enjoyed this project — it brought together everything we’ve learned so far in the course and felt like a real-world example of how these technologies connect.

Integrating Clerk for authentication and connecting it with Supabase for database storage helped me understand how front-end and back-end systems communicate. Seeing it all work together was genuinely rewarding.

I’ve been improving my understanding of database relationships and queries by sketching out table connections and flows, which has helped me visualise how data moves through the app.

If I had more time, I’d like to enhance the overall styling for a more consistent user experience and add functionality for users to leave comments on posts. I’m also interested in exploring component libraries like Radix UI to refine my design and usability skills.

This project reinforced how much I enjoy building functional, user-focused applications and deepened my confidence working with full-stack technologies.
